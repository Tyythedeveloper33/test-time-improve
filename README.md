# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Fully functional 5 question coding quiz 
This project was built in Vs Code, it is an 5 question generated coding quiz to help people understand how the creation process took place in creating a coding qquiz using radio buttons for user input, after you finished the test or run out of time which at first is 75 seconds, later if your restart the test is 50 seconds, it  then prompts you to input your nickname, then places your score on a highscore container with the ability to clear it and start over. This code shows how to do the following:

* Start a timer element on the click of the start quiz button, that subtracts until it hits 0
* Render questions on the click of start button
* Give user feedback if the answer was right or wrong
* Render next question after selecting answer until none are left
*Can save nickname for highscore after questions are answered or timer hits 0

 * Step 4- once VS-Code is open you will click open folder, and find the folder you named in (step #1)

 * Step 10- From here on out this is where you can edit the code to better reflect your own touch to creativity!!
* **Urgent** on line 5 of index you will see my relative pathway for my project, your relative pathway most likely will differ, so go ahead and change it so the index.html, and style.css can work like teamates also in my index html on line 11 is where my href tag is so that your anchor tag goes directly to the highscore page, also ihave it in line 157 of my javascript that relocates to this page on the call of the function!
